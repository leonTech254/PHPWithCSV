# DEAL WITH USER CSV

Define the data-The code begins by defining an array called $data, which represents the rows of the CSV file. Each element of the array corresponds to a row, and each row is an array containing the values for each column.

Set the CSV file name- The variable $filename is used to store the name of the CSV file you want to create. You can modify this variable to set a custom file name.

Open the file for writing- The fopen() function is called with the file name and the mode 'w' to open the file for writing. This function returns a file pointer that is assigned to the variable $file.

Write the data to the CSV file- A foreach loop is used to iterate over each row of the $data array. Inside the loop, the fputcsv() function is called to write each row as a line in the CSV file. This function automatically formats the data and handles any necessary character encoding.

Close the file- After writing all the data, the fclose() function is called to close the file and release system resources.

Prompt the user to download the file-The code sets the appropriate headers using the header() function. It sets the content type as 'application/csv' and the content disposition to indicate that the file should be downloaded as an attachment with the specified filename. The readfile() function is then used to read the contents of the file and output it to the user's browser.
